# Image Gallery Migration from jQuery to React

This project involves migrating an image gallery application from jQuery to React. The original jQuery application displayed a collection of images with the ability to delete individual images. The goal of the migration is to rewrite the application using React components and modern JavaScript practices.

## Features

- Display a collection of images with their corresponding delete buttons
- Delete individual images upon clicking the delete button

## Technologies Used

- React
- JavaScript
- CSS

## Getting Started

To run the migrated React application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the development server: `npm start`

The application will be accessible at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Migration Steps

1. Set up a new React project using Create React App.
2. Identify the key functionality and components in the original jQuery application.
3. Rewrite the application using React components, state, and event handling.
4. Replace jQuery code with React equivalents.
5. Implement the image gallery and delete functionality using React state and event handlers.
6. Style the application using CSS.

## Challenges and Lessons Learned

- Understanding and adapting the existing jQuery code to React's component-based architecture.
- Migrating event handling and state management from jQuery to React.
- Gaining familiarity with React's virtual DOM and component lifecycle.

## Conclusion

The image gallery application has been successfully migrated from jQuery to React, leveraging React's component-based structure and state management. The migration process involved rewriting the application using React components and modern JavaScript practices, resulting in improved code maintainability and extensibility.
